---

Carbon Track is a real-time carbon emissions monitoring system for KTDA's 67 tea factories in Kenya, built to ensure compliance with global regulations like the EU CBAM. It integrates IoT sensors, a Django REST API, and two web portals (Factory and HQ) to track CO₂ emissions, input energy data, and generate compliance reports.

<h2 style="color: blue" >📋 Overview</h2>

Carbon Track enables KTDA tea factories to monitor and manage carbon emissions in real-time, supporting compliance with environmental regulations and improving operational efficiency. The system consists of:





IoT Sensors: Measure CO₂, temperature, and gas velocity in factory chimneys.



Backend API: Django REST Framework for data processing and storage.



Web Portals: Factory Portal for data input and trends; HQ Portal for network-wide insights and leaderboards.

For detailed technical specifications, see the Technical Documentation.
